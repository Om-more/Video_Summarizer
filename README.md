# Video_Summarizer

If you on't want to watch an entire long youtube video a summarizer could help. But we do have platforms like ChatGPT, gemini, claude etc. which could do it then why need this. Well the case is if you diretly put a link of a youtube video or name the specific video these platforms may or maynot be able to catch it. Hence a simple access is needed. And thats where this mini-project could help. It extracts transcripts of the video and with that json file is later simplified and then it uses Gemini 2.0 flash as a generative model for summarizing the text. 
This mini-project could help understanding basic nature of json fie extraction and usage of GenAI in simple terms.
